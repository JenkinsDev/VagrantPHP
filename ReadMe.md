Simple to use Vagrant virtual host setup for you to handle of your PHP 5.5 development. All that you have to do to get started is run the started command:

* `git clone https://www.github.com/JenkinsDev/VagrantPHP`

* `vagrant up`

Now all that is left is to put your projects in the `sites` directory and code to your hearts content! When you are done you can run `vagrant halt` to freeze the Vagrant VM.
